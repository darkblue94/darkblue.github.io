            <div class="desc">
                <p> + With a rich history in Audio Engineering/Event Coordinating,I have actively practiced detailed
                    design and
                    creative direction for multiple projects.</p>
                <p> + Pursing my passion for creation further I attended Coding Dojo, an intensive Full Stack Web
                    Development
                    course that immersed me in 70 hours a week of CODING and WIRE-FRAMING.It not only helped me build
                    the
                    habits of a proficient coder but also the love for the unavoidable obstacles.</p>
                <p> + I am passionate and constantly researching what is new in terms of UI, new ways to
                    build,design,deploy and test.</p>
                <p> + I focus on creating an experience for the end user. Algortihms can be perfected but if they are
                    not easy to interact with they serve no purpose.</p>

                <p> + Information is the new currency, and I dream of becoming apart of the transition into this new
                    standard
                    and interaction of humanity.</p>
                <p> + Creating applications that can innovate Civil Infrastructure and Transportation is a huge goal of
                    mine.
                    Transitioning into a world where city-planning is going to involve technology more then ever is
                    something
                    I want to be in the fore front of. Through organizing community music events I have learned about
                    community
                    needs and how to attend to many individuals and groups that fall under that community umbrella.</p>
                <p> + I am looking to place myself into a company that is not thinking of today or tomorrow, but of the
                    next
                    10 years. Vision and passion are my driving life forces. </p>
                    <h2> Goals </h2>

                <p>Become a contributing developer living in an enviroment that is constant stimulus involving development and the future of it. I want to have learned best practices and have a polished work flow.</p>
                <p> Working on and with new inovations coming to UI.<strong>Gesture Interfaces,Brain-Computer Interface and Voice User Interface</strong></p>
                <p>to become a part of the Rapidly approaching THIRD
                    industrial revolution,
                    the “Sharing Economy” or sometimes put “collaborative consumption or collaborative economy”, where
                    information

                    <p>I created a web-app with React that makes API calls to "food2fork.com" , reviving an object that contains Recipes Names , Links, Publishers and Images. I target my input element of 'name' and pass its value into a const variable which I concatenate in the url that is being fetched. I take all that data into my state, pass it as a prop in my Recipe component. i use the map function to unbox every instance of a recipe that contains the main ingredient that was input by the user.</p>

                <p>Here I made a web-app that makes an API call to "openweathermap.org" , communicating with the server to obtain and filter through weather data. I have a Form component handling the input data of a City and Country of your choice, storing the value into a variable, concatenating the variable into the url.
My Weather component takes in the data , which was sorted in my App componenets stat, as props of Temperature, City,Country,Humidity,Description and error. Visually displaying the JSON data in my Weather component. </p>
