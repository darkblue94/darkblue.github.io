            </div>
            <div class="desc">
                <p> + With a rich history in Audio Engineering/Event Coordinating,I have actively practiced detailed
                    design and
                    creative direction for multiple projects.</p>
                <p> + Pursing my passion for creation further I attended Coding Dojo, an intensive Full Stack Web
                    Development
                    course that immersed me in 70 hours a week of CODING and WIRE-FRAMING.It not only helped me build
                    the
                    habits of a proficient coder but also the love for the unavoidable obstacles.</p>
                <p> + I am passionate and constantly researching what is new in terms of UI, new ways to
                    build,design,deploy and test.</p>
                <p> + I focus on creating an experience for the end user. Algortihms can be perfected but if they are
                    not easy to interact with they serve no purpose.</p>

                <p> + Information is the new currency, and I dream of becoming apart of the transition into this new
                    standard
                    and interaction of humanity.</p>
                <p> + Creating applications that can innovate Civil Infrastructure and Transportation is a huge goal of
                    mine.
                    Transitioning into a world where city-planning is going to involve technology more then ever is
                    something
                    I want to be in the fore front of. Through organizing community music events I have learned about
                    community
                    needs and how to attend to many individuals and groups that fall under that community umbrella.</p>
                <p> + I am looking to place myself into a company that is not thinking of today or tomorrow, but of the
                    next
                    10 years. Vision and passion are my driving life forces. </p>
                <h2> Goals </h2>

                <p>Become a contributing developer living in an enviroment that is constant stimulus involving
                    development and the future of it. I want to have learned best practices and have a polished work
                    flow.</p>
                <p> Working on and with new inovations coming to UI.<strong>Gesture Interfaces,Brain-Computer Interface
                        and Voice User Interface</strong></p>
                <p>to become a part of the Rapidly approaching THIRD
                    industrial revolution,
                    the “Sharing Economy” or sometimes put “collaborative consumption or collaborative economy”, where
                    information
                    and data is accessible and shared from peer to peer. </p>

                            that contains Recipes Names , Links, Publishers and Images. I target my input element of
                            'name' and pass its value into a const variable which I concatenate in the url that is being
                            fetched. I take all that data into my state, pass it as a prop in my Recipe component. i use
                            the map function to unbox every instance of a recipe that contains the main ingredient that
                            was input by the user.</p>

                            the variable into the url.
                            My Weather component takes in the data , which was sorted in my App componenets stat, as
